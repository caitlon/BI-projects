## Overview

This project is a culmination of a series of tasks that involve setting up a data environment, understanding business requests, 
cleaning and transforming data, and finally creating a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI.


This project showcases my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard creation using **Power BI, SQL, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.


## Project Structure

### Business Request: 
Detailed business request, including the desired outcomes, can be found in the document titled *"Business Request.docx"*.

### Database Update: 
I utilized a script to update the database, ensuring that the data remains current and accurate. This, along with other scripts used for data processing, can be found in the *sql_scripts* folder.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation: 
Leveraging SQL and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I've performed various data cleaning and transformation tasks. 
This includes understanding the difference between fact and dimension tables, identifying necessary tables based on user stories, and performing data cleansing and transformation.

Using Power BI, I've created a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the data. 
The dashboard includes various visualizations such as pie charts, line charts, bar charts, map graphs, and more.
