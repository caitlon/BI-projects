## Netflix Analysis 

I imported CSV file of the Netflix titles data and then went through the different fields included in the dataset. 
They explain how each movie or TV show, having a unique **show ID**, a **type** (movie or TV show), 
**title**, **director**, **cast**, **date added** to Netflix, **release year**, **rating**, **duration**, **category** and **description**,
come out in the full data analysis.

In that project are shown plots of different TV shows and movies added to Netflix by date, 
converted it into an area chart, and changed the colours to match the Netflix theme. 
Then created a map that defines each country by color based on the total number of movies and TV shows released.
