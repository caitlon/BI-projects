# Tableau projects

Tableau visualization projects provide a comprehensive and interactive view of the company's sales performance, 
allowing the company to make data-driven decisions that can help it grow and succeed in its market.

The visualizations are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing non-technical users to explore and interact with the data. 
Users can filter the data by various dimensions, such as product category, region, and time period, 
to get a more granular view of the company's sales performance.
